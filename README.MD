Laser reflecting puzzle games can be a lot of fun and a great logic challenge. I wanted to create such a game with Phaser for a Mintbean hack-a-thon. This was the first time I had ever used Phaser before and had a ton of fun working on this project. Regrettably, I started implementing a logic that I found out, too late, was not going to work. I was trying to make the laser reflect off the mirrors and have Phaser track its progress across the grid. I found out that Phaser was not able to track the lines I was drawing. As it was my first time using Phaser, I didn't realize I was doing things backward. I then realized I needed to pretty much scratch everything and start all over... the night before the deadline for the hack-a-thon. I managed to get the mirrors in place and get the logic for the laser reflections to work but, alas, was not able to get the levels built and win conditions set up so I was unable to submit. I really wanted to finish this project up, but there was always something else to take my time (group projects with other people depending on me, other hack-a-thons etc) but am now ready to get back to work. I'm gonna finish this bad boy!
